@NODE SQUAWK "Squawk"
@{JCENTER}@{b}@{u}Squawk@{uu}@{ub}
@{JLEFT}
Squawk files are Amiga IFF files that contain Game data. Usually there
are a number of Squark files that make up a Game.

As a general rule, Squark files are numbered 0 to 255 with the "parrot"
file extension.

The 0.parrot file is the master table, which contains essential game 
information, asset lookup tables, palettes, some essential scripts and
image and sound data. It is loaded at all times, and their contents 
loaded as assets within memory at game initialisation.

The 1+ parrot files typically represent a single room, with the 
necessary scripts, image, sound, entity and actor data that is 
typically in a room. This data may be loaded, or partially loaded based
on the game state.

Squawk files are also referred to as Archives within the C code.

@{u}Chunk Id@{uu}


The Chunk Id is a UWORD start starts from 1 to 65535.


@{u}Chunk Flags@{uu}

ch_Flags are populated by the CHUNK_FLAGS enum, these can be the
following values:

Bit 0:  Asset is for the ECS Arch
Bit 1:  Asset is for the AGA Arch
Bit 2:  Asset is for the RTS Arch
Bit 13: Asset may be larger than the Chunk Type specifies, this may be
        due to a sub-type like Entities, or it has dynamic data - such
        as a Script.
Bit 14: Asset has some extra data appended at the end of the asset 
        which requires a special function to load and unload the data.
        This is specified by the CHUNK_FACTORY of that type. Not to be
        confused with Bit 13.
Bit 15: This asset should be ignored and not loaded.

Note:

Bits 0,1,2 May be OR'd together to represent that the asset can be
           loaded regardless of architecture, and this is recommended
           practise for assets that are not backdrops, images or audio
           data.

        This is specified by the CHUNK_FACTORY of that type. Not to be
        confused with Bit 13.
Bit 15: This asset should be ignored and not loaded.

Note:

Bits 0,1,2 May be OR'd together to represent that the asset can be
           loaded regardless of architecture, and this is recommended
           practise for assets that are not backdrops, images or audio
           data.
