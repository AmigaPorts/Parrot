Dialogue
# Dialogue

Dialogue refers to usually anything written down, such as the following:

- Dialogue between two or more Actors in a scene
- Dialogue between an actor to the player
- Narration dialogue to the player
- Written action events
- User Interface
- Program Help Text

Dialogue is stored in tables of strings [String Table](CT_STRING_TABLE), it
is referenced by a 4 byte Id, which is in two parts.

  struct DIALOGUE_TEXT
  {
    UWORD   dt_Table;
    UBYTE   dt_Pad;
    UBYTE   dt_Item;
  };

  Dialogue Text may be referred to as a Big-Endian ULONG or as a 
  C DIALOGUE_TEXT structure.

It is recommended that common Dialogue is stored in the master archive;
0.parrot. Where as chapter or room dialogue stored in other dedicated
archives.

It should be noted, that individual pieces of dialogue cannot be sourced
from Disk, as it will bring in all of that Dialogue stored in that 
STRING_TABLE at once. So it is recommended to stored Dialogue together
based on story or location to reduce disk and memory usage.

Dialogue Ids are language neutral, as each STRING_TABLE has a ISO-639-1
code in them, so the Dialogue ID for one piece of text is the same
regardless of the language translation

It should be noted that a string may only have 255 characters, so in
some circumstances some of that string may have to be cut in length.
