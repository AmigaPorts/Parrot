Coding Style
# Coding Style

Parrot is written in C and is compiled by the VBCC compiler.

## Braces

Seperate lines

  if (x == 2)
  {
    /* Action */
  }

## Comments

  /* Always this */
  // Never this

## Structs

Structures are always referred to "struct Name" never
"Name" through a typedef.

Fields of the structure taken on a prefix of the name
of the structure.

  struct Lever
  {
    ULONG lv_Strength;
    ULONG lv_Length;
    BOOL  lv_IsDown;
  };

## Functions

Although there is no strict rule with this;

Functions that deal with utilities or extending C code, it should 
use the SubjectAction naming

  StrLength
  GfxText
  ScriptsInitialise

Anything that is more to do with gameplay then:

  PlayRoom
  LoadAsset
  NewObject

## Naming

Functions and Classes are always in TitleCase

  PlayRoom

  struct Room;

Parameters are always in camelCase

  roomNum

Fields always start with lowercase prefix
then TitleCase

  rm_Width

## Enums

Enumerations should be defined as pre-processor Macros as 
UPPER_UNDERSCORE case.

  #define ETF_IS_NAMED  (1 << 0)
  #define ETF_IS_LOCKED (1 << 14)
  #define ETF_IS_OPEN   (1 << 15)

Where the first word is an abbreviation of the subject and
the following words are the name.

They should be placed near the first use of them in a 
structure or function.

## Includes and Headers

With Parrot.h being the exception

Headers should not include other headers, including Parrot.h

Headers should only contain

  Function Prototypes
  Struct Prototypes
  Enums
  IFF or Node IDs

Public structures should be placed in Parrot.h

As Headers are only used .c files, Headers do not need #ifndef
#define #endif Guards.

When using Parrot includes must be in the form of

  #include <Parrot/Xyz.h>

When using Amiga OS includes they must be in the form of

  #include <exec/types.h>

## Types

Parrot uses the types from <exec/types.h> as its POD types.

These are:-

  UBYTE   Unsigned  8-bit Integer
  BYTE    Signed    8-bit Integer
  UWORD   Unsigned  16-bit Integer
  WORD    Signed    16-bit Integer
  ULONG   Unsigned  32-bit Integer
  LONG    Signed    32-bit Integer

  VOID    void
  APTR    void*
  BOOL    Boolean
  STRPTR  char*

## Other Macros

Other Macros should be used as well:

  EXTERN instead of extern
  CONST  instead of const
  STATIC instead of static
  VOID   instead of void
  
  These are defined in <exec/types.h> and <parrot/Parrot.h>
