### Slugs

A slug is the asset ID encoded as a 4-byte word via the UWordToId
function, and placed within the IFF Chunk Type:-

    PtUnsigned32   Chunk Type
    PtUnsigned32   Length

It takes each nibble of the PtUnsigned16 and places for each byte in the
integer in little-endian order. Each byte is then added by a constant
of 0x41 to make the number compatible with FourCC. 

    PtUnsigned32 s;
    
    s = 0x41;
    s += (r & 0xF);
    s <<= 8;
    r >>= 4;

    s += 0x41;
    s += (r & 0xF);
    s <<= 8;
    r >>= 4;

    s += 0x41;
    s += (r & 0xF);
    s <<= 8;
    r >>= 4;

    s += 0x41;
    s += (r & 0xF);

    return s;

A ID with 0, is written as AAAA, an ID with 1 is BAAA, and so on.

Although this is against the intentions of the IFF specification, 
it does not give an alternate method for searching through chunks 
without inspecting the data. As the type of data is held within 
the parent chunk, then it provides a quick and easy way of 
iteration without inspecting or knowing how the asset data is 
stored.

### Asset Header

The Asset Header is a four byte table placed after the IFF Chunk
Header but before any of the Asset Data.

  struct ASSET_HEADER
  {
    PtUnsigned16 ah_Id;
    PtUnsigned16 ah_AssetFlags;
  };

#### Asset Id

The Id is a PtUnsigned16 start starts from 1 to 65535. This is a repeat
of the Slug in the Chunk Type, but in its original form.

#### Asset Flags

ah_AssetFlags are populated by the CHUNK_FLAGS enum, these can be 
the following values:

Bit 0:  Asset is for the ECS Arch
Bit 1:  Asset is for the AGA Arch
Bit 2:  Asset is for the RTS Arch
Bit 13: Asset may be larger than the Chunk Type specifies, this may be
        due to a sub-type like Entities, or it has dynamic data - such
        as a Script.
Bit 14: Asset has some extra data appended at the end of the asset 
        which requires a special function to load and unload the data.
        This is specified by the CHUNK_FACTORY of that type. Not to be
        confused with Bit 13.
Bit 15: This asset should be ignored and not loaded.

Note:

Bits 0,1,2 May be OR'd together to represent that the asset can be
           loaded regardless of architecture, and this is recommended
           practise for assets that are not backdrops, images or audio
           data.

### Asset Data

The Data is stored after the Asset Header. These may be:

- [Game Info](ct_gameinfo)
- [Table](ct_table)
