# Squawk

Squawk files are Amiga IFF files that contain Game data. Usually there
are a number of Squark files that make up a Game.

As a general rule, Squark files are numbered 0 to 255 with the "parrot"
file extension.

The 0.parrot file is the master table, which contains essential game 
information, asset lookup tables, palettes, some essential scripts and
image and sound data. It is loaded at all times, and their contents 
loaded as assets within memory at game initialisation.

The 1+ parrot files typically represent a single room, with the 
necessary scripts, image, sound, entity and actor data that is 
typically in a room. This data may be loaded, or partially loaded based
on the game state.

Squawk files are also referred to as Archives within the C code.
